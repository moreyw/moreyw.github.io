    <p>Tarsus is a web based role playing game that allows users to create their own characters every time they play. It was created as a group project in my Distributed Client Serve Programming class.</p>

<p>The store page
Once a user created a character they could then buy items from a shop, upgrade items with the blacksmith, or fight other characters of the same level. A user could keep playing with and upgrading the character until they lost in a fight.</p>

<p>A list of one user’s fallen characters
After losing a battle a character would be considered “dead.” The dead characters were the ones that would be called upon to fight new user characters. This allowed for players to try to make as strong a character as possible so that it would be more and more difficult for other players to advance with their own characters.</p>

<p>We used a Java for the backend and logic of the project and a MySQL database to store information about the characters and the items that they used. I was responsible for the HTML and CSS for the project as well as the database design and the Java functions that interacted with it.​</p>
