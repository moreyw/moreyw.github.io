Designed and implemented a multi-platform application to allow temporary employees to schedule working hours themselves rather than needing to contact someone at the company. Used InVision to provide interactive prototypes during development to show stakeholders how the final app would function. Was responsible for the HTML/CSS/Sass to create the interface for the app, as well as a large portion of the appâ€™s functionality through JavaScript. The app has since been rolled out to employees.
